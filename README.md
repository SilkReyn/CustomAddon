# CustomAddon
An IPA (Illusion Plugin Architecture) plugin for Holodance. It is the logic to load custom assets into the game in general, but is hardcoded to load my named custom avatar asset bundles.

Works with Holodance V0.9.0b21

Ingame control:
-------------
`L` Load avatar prefab
`<` Turn avatar origin left
`>` Turm avatar origin right
`T` Show next avatar prefab in asset bundle
`Up` Move head target upwards
`Down` Move head target downwards

Dependencies:
